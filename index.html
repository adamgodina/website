        <h2>Inflation Explained</h2>
        <p>What is inflation? While inflation is constantly in the news--especially with the recent effects of the COVID pandemic--it is a very unintuitive concept to grasp. 
            It is easy to think of money as an unchanging constant, however in reality this could not be further from the case. Inflation refers to the relative change in the buying power of money over time.
            You have probably noticed how goods and services have been increasing recently, and this change is inflation. Any good or service will have a "real" value that remains constant while also having a "nominal" value, which is the face value in dollars.
            For example the median home price in 1970 was $23,500, while 50 years later in 2020, the median home price was $327,100. While it is true that our building practices have improved since 1970, using common sense, 
            we know that a house purchased in 2020 is not intrinsically worth 14x more than a house purchased in 1970. It is not the real value of the house that has increased, but the relative decline in the purchasing power of the US dollar.

          <h2>Deflation Explained</h2>
          <p>While it is easy to think that inflation is an overall negative phenomen, we actually want a small constant level of inflation. The opposite of inflation--deflation is much worse and can lead to a self-repeating cycle of stagnation and economic contraction.
            Deflation is when prices continue to fall, so your purchasing power actually increases over time. While this sounds great, it disincentivizes consumers to spend. This decrease in consumer spending means that goods and services are not being purchased, which causes real wages to decrease.
            This causes even less consumer spending since consumers have less disposable income which makese the problem worse. Additionally, while wages fall, the real value of debt increases, while the ability for debtholders to pay off that debt decreases.
            This cycle is very hard to break, as consumer expectations are one of the biggest drivers of inflation or deflation, and once consumers expect either, it is hard to reverse consumer sentiment. Japan is a famous example of modern deflation, and has struggled with deflation since the 1990s, despite the efforts of the Bank of Japan and the Japanese Government.
